# portfolio-website
This repository contains a basic portfolio webpage that I created while learning the core concepts of HTML and CSS.
The purpose of this project was to understand how a simple web page is structured and how styling can be applied using CSS. It represents one of my early practice exercises in front-end development and GitHub usage.

## About the Project
